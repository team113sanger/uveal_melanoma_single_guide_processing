## Analysis
Please see NOTEBOOKS/pyCROQUET.html for more information about how CRISPR counts were generated.

## Summary
CRISPRko screens were performed in 10 uveal melanoma cell lines expressing Cas9 (3 replicates) using the Human CRISPR Library (Yusa v1.1). Samples at day 14 of screen were quantified along with a previous sequencing run of the pooled plasmids which were used to generate the library.

This project contains:

7 cell lines from SequenceScape study 5621: OMM23, MP41, MP38, OMM1, Mel270, MP46, OMM25
3 cell lines from SequenceScape study 5821: Mel285, 92.1, Mel202
Only two Mel285 replicates are present in study 5621 (Mel285_c909R2 and Mel285_c909R3) as one replicate failed. As a result, the Mel285 screen was repeats with three replicates in study 5821 (Mel285_R5, Mel285_R6, Mel285_R7).
